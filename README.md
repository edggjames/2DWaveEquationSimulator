# 2DWaveEquationSimulator

This project shows how I derived a numerical solution to the wave equation in 2D  
using a second-order accurate central difference scheme for derivatives in both  
space and time (Equation 7 in Written_Report.pdf).

This update equation was implemented in MATLAB in a vectorised fashion for an  
acoustic pressure field, for a range of initial conditions, boundary conditions  
and spatial and temporal sampling resolutions.
